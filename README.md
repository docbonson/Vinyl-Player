# Vinyl-Player
This is my first crack at a Media Player. Been working on learning a lot of the UI that is invovled with creating something like this. Thought it would be fun to make a spinning vinyl player.

-Use animations in order to create a working spinning vinyl media player.

-Wire up widgets for play and pause functions.

-Implement a seek bar that works when mp3 file is playing. 

I plan on adding more to this and working towards implementing a way for the user to click on the vinyl and be able to spin it to rewind or fast foward the track.
